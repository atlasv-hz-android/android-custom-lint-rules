Android has traditionally used 4 KB memory page sizes. However, to
support future devices that only work with 16 KB aligned libraries apps
containing native libraries need to be built with 16 KB alignment.

Apps with 4 KB aligned native libraries may not work correctly on
devices requiring 16 KB alignment. To ensure compatibility and
future-proof your app, it is strongly recommended that your native
libraries are aligned to 16 KB boundaries.

If your app uses any NDK libraries, directly or indirectly through an
SDK, you should rebuild your app to meet this recommendation. Make sure
all native libraries within your application, including those from
dependencies, are built with 16 KB page alignment.

This lint check looks at all native libraries that your app depends on.
If any are found to be aligned to 4 KB instead of 16 KB, you will need
to address this.

When a library is flagged, first try to update to a newer version that
supports 16 KB alignment. If an updated version is not available,
contact the library vendor to ask about their plans for 16 KB support
and request a compatible version. Updating your libraries proactively
will help ensure your app works properly on a wider range of devices.

(##) Example

Here is an example of lint warnings produced by this check:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~text
build.gradle:2:Warning: The native library
arm64-v8a/libtensorflowlite_jni.so (from
org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite:2.16.1) is not 16 KB aligned
[Aligned16KB]
    implementation("org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite:2.16.1")
                   ---------------------------------------
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here are the relevant test files:

`build.gradle`:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~groovy linenumbers
dependencies {
    implementation("org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite:2.16.1")
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[build/intermediates/exploded-aar/org.tensorflow/tensorflow-lite/2.16.1/jni/arm64-v8a/libtensorflowlite_jni.so](examples/arm64-v8a/libtensorflowlite_jni.so)

[build/intermediates/exploded-aar/org.tensorflow/tensorflow-lite/2.16.1/jni/x86_64/libtensorflowlite_jni.so](examples/x86_64/libtensorflowlite_jni.so)

[build/intermediates/exploded-aar/org.tensorflow/tensorflow-lite/2.16.1/jni/armeabi-v7a/libtensorflowlite_jni.so](examples/armeabi-v7a/libtensorflowlite_jni.so)

for the unit tests for this check to see additional scenarios.

(##) Suppressing

You can suppress false positives using one of the following mechanisms:

* Using a suppression comment like this on the line above:

  ```kt
  //noinspection Aligned16KB
  problematicStatement()
  ```

* Using a special `lint.xml` file in the source tree which turns off
  the check in that folder and any sub folder. A simple file might look
  like this:
  ```xml
  &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
  &lt;lint&gt;
      &lt;issue id="Aligned16KB" severity="ignore" /&gt;
  &lt;/lint&gt;
  ```
  Instead of `ignore` you can also change the severity here, for
  example from `error` to `warning`. You can find additional
  documentation on how to filter issues by path, regular expression and
  so on
  [here](https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/usage/lintxml.md.html).

* In Gradle projects, using the DSL syntax to configure lint. For
  example, you can use something like
  ```gradle
  lintOptions {
      disable 'Aligned16KB'
  }
  ```
  In Android projects this should be nested inside an `android { }`
  block.

* For manual invocations of `lint`, using the `--ignore` flag:
  ```
  $ lint --ignore Aligned16KB ...`
  ```

* Last, but not least, using baselines, as discussed
  [here](https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/usage/baselines.md.html).
