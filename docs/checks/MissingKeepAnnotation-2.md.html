Type-safe nav arguments such as Enum types can get incorrectly
obfuscated in minified builds when not referenced directly.

(##) Conflicts

This issue id has also been used by other, unrelated lint checks. Issue
id's must be unique, so you cannot combine these libraries. Also defined
in:
* MissingKeepAnnotation: In minified builds, Enum classes used as type-safe Navigation arguments should be annotated with @androidx.annotation.Keep (this issue)
* [MissingKeepAnnotation from androidx.navigation:navigation-common:2.9.0-rc01](MissingKeepAnnotation.md.html)
* [MissingKeepAnnotation from androidx.navigation:navigation-runtime:2.9.0-rc01](MissingKeepAnnotation-3.md.html)


(##) Including

!!!
   This is not a built-in check. To include it, add the below dependency
   to your project.

```
// build.gradle.kts
implementation("androidx.navigation:navigation-compose:2.9.0-rc01")

// build.gradle
implementation 'androidx.navigation:navigation-compose:2.9.0-rc01'

// build.gradle.kts with version catalogs:
implementation(libs.navigation.compose)

# libs.versions.toml
[versions]
navigation-compose = "2.9.0-rc01"
[libraries]
# For clarity and text wrapping purposes the following declaration is
# shown split up across lines, but in TOML it needs to be on a single
# line (see https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/issues/516) so adjust
# when pasting into libs.versions.toml:
navigation-compose = {
    module = "androidx.navigation:navigation-compose",
    version.ref = "navigation-compose"
}
```

2.9.0-rc01 is the version this documentation was generated from;
there may be newer versions available.

(##) Suppressing

You can suppress false positives using one of the following mechanisms:

* Using a suppression annotation like this on the enclosing
  element:

  ```kt
  // Kotlin
  @Suppress("MissingKeepAnnotation")
  fun method() {
     composable(...)
  }
  ```

  or

  ```java
  // Java
  @SuppressWarnings("MissingKeepAnnotation")
  void method() {
     composable(...);
  }
  ```

* Using a suppression comment like this on the line above:

  ```kt
  //noinspection MissingKeepAnnotation
  problematicStatement()
  ```

* Using a special `lint.xml` file in the source tree which turns off
  the check in that folder and any sub folder. A simple file might look
  like this:
  ```xml
  &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
  &lt;lint&gt;
      &lt;issue id="MissingKeepAnnotation" severity="ignore" /&gt;
  &lt;/lint&gt;
  ```
  Instead of `ignore` you can also change the severity here, for
  example from `error` to `warning`. You can find additional
  documentation on how to filter issues by path, regular expression and
  so on
  [here](https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/usage/lintxml.md.html).

* In Gradle projects, using the DSL syntax to configure lint. For
  example, you can use something like
  ```gradle
  lintOptions {
      disable 'MissingKeepAnnotation'
  }
  ```
  In Android projects this should be nested inside an `android { }`
  block.

* For manual invocations of `lint`, using the `--ignore` flag:
  ```
  $ lint --ignore MissingKeepAnnotation ...`
  ```

* Last, but not least, using baselines, as discussed
  [here](https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/usage/baselines.md.html).
